# Game sounds

Place these MP3 files here for in-game audio (Howler.js):

| File          | Use                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `menu.mp3`    | Menu / lobby (looping music)  |
| `blitz-quiz.mp3` | Blitz quiz phase (looping) |
| `hunt.mp3`    | Hunt phase (looping music)    |
| `timer.mp3`   | Warning music when hunt has 10s left (looping) |
| `coin.mp3`    | Local player collects coin    |
| `tag.mp3`     | Local player (unicorn) tags someone |
| `frozen.mp3`  | Local player gets frozen      |
| `game-over.mp3` | Game ends                    |

If a file is missing, that sound is simply not played (no error).
